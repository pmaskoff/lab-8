For this week's lab, we will be revisiting questions from previous lab
assignments, with the purpose of using functions from the `map()` family to 
iterate over certain tasks. To do this, we will need to load in the data from 
Lab 2, Lab 3, and Lab 7. I've included **all** three datasets in the `data`
folder, so all you need to do is read them in. ðŸ™ƒ 

```{r}
#| label: read-in-old-data

# Data from Lab 2
surveys <- read_csv(here::here("data", "surveys.csv"))

# Data from Lab 3
evals <- read_csv(here::here("data", "teacher_evals.csv")) |> 
  rename(sex = gender)

# Data from Lab 7
fish <- read_csv(here::here("data", "BlackfootFish.csv"))
```

## Lab 2

First up, we're going to revisit Question 3 from Lab 2. This question asked:

> What are the data types of the variables in this dataset?

**1. Using `map_chr()`, produce a nicely formatted table of the data type of each variable in the `surveys` dataset.** Specifically, the table should have 15 columns, one for
each variable, with the datatype of that variable immediately below it's name. 

```{r}
#| label: map-data-types-of-surveys

maptype <- function(df) {
  tibble(variable = names(df), 
         type = map_chr(df, class))
}

surveys_type <- maptype(surveys)

surveys_type <- surveys_type |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
              values_from = type)

surveys_type |>
  kable()
```

## Lab 3

Now, were on to Lab 3 where we will revisit two questions. 

In the original version of Lab 3, Question 5 asked you to:

> Change data types in whichever way you see fit (e.g., is the instructor ID
> really a numeric data type?)

**2. Using `map_at()`, convert the `teacher_id`, `weekday`, `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `gender` columns to factors.** Hint: You will need to use `bind_cols()` to transform the 
list output back into a data frame. 

```{r}
#| label: map-to-mutate-columns

map_column_factor <- function(df, variables) {
  colfact <- map_at(df, variables, as.factor)
  bind_cols(colfact)
}

colfacts <- c("teacher_id", "weekday", "academic_degree", "seniority", "gender")

fct_evals <- map_column_factor(evals, colfacts)

fct_evals_type <- maptype(fct_evals)

fct_evals_type |>
  kable()
# fyi multiple rows per professor
```

Next up, we're going revisit Question 7 which asked:
> What are the demographics of the instructors in this study? Investigate the
> variables `academic_degree`, `seniority`, and `sex` and summarize your
> findings in ~3 complete sentences.

Many people created **multiple** tables of counts for each of these
demographics, but in this exercise we are going to create **one** table with 
every demographic.

**3. Using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, recreate the table below.**

I'm using the `sen_level` classification from Challenge 3

- `"junior"` = `seniority` is 4 or less (inclusive)
- `"senior"` = `seniority` is more than 4 
:::

```{r}
#| label: double-pivot-for-summary-table

evals_summary <- evals |>
  distinct(teacher_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  mutate(sen_level = if_else(seniority <= 4, "Junior (4 years or less)", 
                            "Senior (more than 4 years)")
         ) |>
  summarise(
    Female = sum(sex == "female"),
    Male = sum(sex == "male"),
    `Junior (4 years or less)` = sum(sen_level == "Junior (4 years or less)"),
    `Senior (more than 4 years)` = sum(sen_level == "Senior (more than 4 years)"),
    `No Degree` = sum(academic_degree == "no_dgr"),
    Masters = sum(academic_degree == "ma"),
    Doctorate = sum(academic_degree == "dr"),
    Professor = sum(academic_degree == "prof")
  )

evals_summary |>
  kable()
  
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you are interested in exploring my table fomatting, I specifically used the 
`kable()` function from the **knitr** package to first get an HTML table. Then
I styled that table using the `kable_styling()` function from the **kableExtra**
package.

## Lab 7

For our last problem, we will revisit a question from the most recent lab. 
Question 1 asked you to use `across()` to make a table which summarized: 

> What variable(s) have missing values present?  
> How many observations have missing values?

**4. Using `map_int()`, produce a nicely formatted table of the number of missing values for each variable in the `fish` data.** 

```{r}
#| label: map-missing-values-of-fish

missing_values_summary <- tibble(
  `Variables` = names(fish),
  `Missing Count` = map_int(fish, ~sum(is.na(.)))
) |>
  filter(`Missing Count` > 0)

missing_values_summary |>
  kable()

```



```
